### Week Beginning 26/10/15
 Progress includes all research over summer into different algorithms and implementation details.

#####  Meeting with Dr Friedetzky (27/10/15):
###### Discussion points:
* Discussed implementation details & use of libraries
    - Focus is on algorithmic quality, not UI
    - With that in mind, 2D ascii is the likely choice
    - Other alternatives explored include unity, Dart
    - To be explored further: Jframe, Libjsci
* Discussed lack of scientific literature
    - Some of the best resources come from informal sources\casual programmers\blogs
    - These can be used but validity needs to be recognised
* Discussed the idea of multiple focuses
    - It's okay to have more than one focus
    - Experimental work on related outside topics is encouraged, even if outcome is unfeasible/unhelpful
* Discussed reproducible seeding
    - Decided to proceed with reproducible seeding
* Discussed the topic of puzzle research
    - Might be fruitless but worth looking into
    - Potential to edit deliverables
 
###### Objectives for next week:
* Look into ways of formalising and recording ideas
* Improve recording process
* Look at GitHub or similar
* Look into use of Latex for report writing
* Draft Project Plan
