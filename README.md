## Rogue-like Game Individual Project - Project Log  
Repository for roguelike game level 3 individual project.

###Week Beginning 23/11/15
##### Progress:
* Researched + learnt about version control- downloaded EGit for Eclipse
* Researched applet creation for related browser game interaction
* Looked at tutorial on building the structure for the implementation [(Trystan's Blog)](http://trystans.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/roguelike-tutorial-03-scrolling-through.html)
* Learned about data structures 
    - Plan for 2d ascii array for display
    - 2d array of arrays for metadata
* Looked into Cellular automata approach see [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels)
    - Has merits and disadvantages
    - Produces interesting cavelike structures
    - Can produce disconnected graphs, too open structures
* Plans for using noise algorithms with some computational physics in differential height and deterministic and non deterministic gradient descent algorithms 

##### Meeting with Dr Friedetzky (24/11/15):
* Discussed plans for progression
* Advice to work on deterministic methods first and then perturbing them with random approaches
* Look more into Hilbert Curves + Noise algorithm/ cellular automata hybrid
* For an extended objective, look at 3d noise approach and smooth out with a gradient descent algorithm for pathfinding through the route

##### Objectives: 
* Continue to investigate algorithmic options as discussed in meeting
* Continue to develop implementation -> try simple approaches for noise algorithms, cellular automata, Hilbert curves by Christmas

### Week Beginning 16/11/15
##### Progress:
* Learned markdown language for project log on GitHub repository
* Read through related work titles sent by Dr Friedetzky
* Set up online project log
* Currently looking into polygonal map generation demo still

##### Meeting with Dr Friedetzky (18/11/15):
* Discussed Nethack and alternatives like ADOM and Anglan wrt world building approaches
* Discussed possibility of hexagonal grids + associated challenges
* Discussed fractal approaches
* Discussed merits of using hybrid approaches for world building to produce interesting results

##### Objectives:
* Mostly research based this week- come up with new ideas for algorithmic approaches
* Look at hybridisation of ideas
* Make a start on implementation structure (including set up of Eclipse/ IDE)

### Week Beginning 9/11/15
##### Progress:
* Converted project plan to Latex
* Research resulted in finding a good demonstration into [polygonal map generation](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)
* Learned finer details of GitHub repositories and now have a workable cloned directory

##### Meeting with Dr Friedetzky (10/11/15):
###### Discussion points:
* Note importance of data structures
    - Important implementation details now have big effects on end project
    - Potential to experiment with a few to see outcomes
    - Possibility for nested 2d arrays?
* Discussed looking into polygonal generation demo and creating a similar result in Java
* Discussed possibility of reading into related work

##### Objectives:
* Aim to have a working demo of the polygonal generation to get an idea and feel for data structures and algorithmic techniques
* Read design report and project plans from related work
* Continue with producing online project log (maybe in form of a blog?)

### Week Beginning 2/11/15
##### Progress:
* Progress includes the creation of GitHub repository to store code and to have an online record of work (this project log). 
* Attended University skills session workshop for introduction to Latex
* Completed project plan
* Plan to begin recording meetings with Dr Friedetzky formally each week for project log

##### Meeting with Dr Friedetzky (04/11/15):
###### Discussion points:
* Log book clarification
* Project plan amendments
* Discussed design report
    - Early implementation stages
    - How I envision it all to work together
    - Agile/waterfall construction?
    - How the work will be done
    - How will the work be tested/evaluated?

##### Objectives:
* Continue to learn Latex
* Create project log
* Research some more algorithmic techniques

### Week Beginning 26/10/15
 Progress includes all research over summer into different algorithms and implementation details.

#####  Meeting with Dr Friedetzky (27/10/15):
###### Discussion points:
* Discussed implementation details & use of libraries
    - Focus is on algorithmic quality, not UI
    - With that in mind, 2D ascii is the likely choice
    - Other alternatives explored include unity, Dart
    - To be explored further: Jframe, Libjsci
* Discussed lack of scientific literature
    - Some of the best resources come from informal sources\casual programmers\blogs
    - These can be used but validity needs to be recognised
* Discussed the idea of multiple focuses
    - It's okay to have more than one focus
    - Experimental work on related outside topics is encouraged, even if outcome is infeasible/unhelpful
* Discussed reproducible seeding
    - Decided to proceed with reproducible seeding
* Discussed the topic of puzzle research
    - Might be fruitless but worth looking into
    - Potential to edit deliverables
 
##### Objectives for next week:
* Look into ways of formalising and recording ideas
* Improve recording process
* Look at GitHub or similar
* Look into use of Latex for report writing
* Draft Project Plan
